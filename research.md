My current project deals with the construction of a nutrient signaling model in the 
budding yeast *S. cerevisiae*. For more details, check out my [blog post]({{site.url}}/2017/01/01/nutrient-signaling.html).

I have also made an interactive app to learn about [mechanistic cell cycle models](http://cellcyclemodels.herokuapp.com)
