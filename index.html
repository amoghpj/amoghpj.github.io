<h1>How did you end up on Amogh Jalihal's webpage on github...?</h1>
<p style="font-style:italic;color:#000080">This page is going to be under development for ever and for ever.</p>
If you are curious, <a href="profile.html">this</a> is how I look sometimes.  
A <a href="cv.tex">latex</a> and <a href="cv.pdf">PDF</a> versions of my CV <a style="color:green">as on 151205</a> is here.

<a href="web_links.html">Here<a> is a page that contains some of my projects.

A major challenge I faced during my rotation with the Hauf Lab was maintaining an electronic lab notebook. The advantages of maintaining a paper Lab Notebook are many, including the fact that you can scribble notes and observations at will, it is easy to carry around, and remains a physical record of the mistakes and corrections that you make. On the other hand, the advantages of an electronic labnotebook seem, now, to outweigh those of a traditional paper record. It took me a while to get used to typing out observations and comments during the experiment instead of writing them down, but the fact that it isn't really hard at all. I have experimented with OO  and have created a labnotebook template including features for making ToDo lists and comments/observations sections not directly pertinent to the experiment. You can find it <a href="AJ_NB_Template.ott">here</a>. However, I have also come across the amazing power and magnificent beauty of LaTex (again!), and will now use <a href="http://www.latextemplates.com/template/daily-laboratory-book">this</a> package, which seems perfect for my needs.
