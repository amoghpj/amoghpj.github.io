<p>I am a graduate student at Virginia Tech, and my current research interest is the dynamical modeling of biological processes, specifically in the context of yeast biology. This webpage is my attempt at documenting some of my computational adventures systematically, and is essentially a hodge-podge of random things I have learned in my journey as a PhD student so far. Apart from microscopy, scripting and mathematical modeling, I also like listening to and making music, and love the beautiful outdoors here in Virginia. </p>
