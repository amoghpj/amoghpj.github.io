The advent of the Internet has meant that education has changed rapidly in the last thirty years to the abrupt, and massive increase in /accessibility/ to resources. Any answer is now a Googleâ„¢ away, and, as [Terry Heick discusses]({http://www.teachthought.com/critical-thinking/how-google-impacts-the-way-students-think/)} in his article, this kind of increased accessibility comes with its own problems. (The fact that I used a Google Search to come across this article just reinforces his point!)

Listing out the ways in which the Internet has affected education here would be impractical, but the top three benefits, in my view would be

- Resources for research (think Google Scholar, and how it has changed lit reviews)
- Increased access in developing countries (MOOCs)
- New opportunities for skill building (Adult education is a great example)

There is no doubt that services that have popped up in the Internet age have been greatly disruptive to the traditional education industry. A case in point is the passionate debate over MOOCs, or Massively Online Open Courses. Players like Coursera, edX, and Khan Academy  are definitely changing the access to quality educational resources, and have been hailed as the next age of education, where students attend classes remotely. This has led to debate on restructuring of institutions of higher education, leading to paradigms where massive infrastructure in terms of classrooms and laboratories are no longer needed, and are replaced by online forums and communities which are truly global and diverse.

The opponents of MOOCs argue that this massive expansion in terms of accessibility does little for the quality education. As elaborated by [Jonathan Reese]({http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/07/moocs_could_be_disastrous_for_students_and_professors.html}) in his article criticizing MOOCs, he protests:
>Education, as any real teacher will tell you, involves more than just transmitting facts. It means teaching students what to do with those facts, as well as the skills they need to go out and learn new information themselves.

This week, the topic of net neutrality has been making the rounds again, with the President voicing his views against net neutrality. This has sparked off debates and petitions like [this one]({http://glenechogroup.isebox.net/library-and-education-internet-freedom/higher-education-library-groups-urge-fcc-chair-to-uphold-net-neutrality-principles}).
