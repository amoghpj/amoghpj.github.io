I think one of the best decisions I made since starting grad school is investing
the time to learn git and github, and using these tools to maintain my website.
The git history of [this repo](https://amoghpj.github.io) is very reflective of the learning curve for git: too many
changes or too few changes per commit, terrible commit messages, and tons of unnecessary 
files. But I am glad that I have stuck to one repo, because it has allowed me to
roll back to older versions and see what they looked like. Here's the gallery.

# 2016-2017

The oldest commit on the repo is from the 5th of December 2015, a plain HTML page with
some ascii art of my face. But starting in November 2016, I started using the minimal mistakes theme.

# 2017-2019

In the second year of my PhD, probably inspired by people like Daniel Chen and Mitch Wagner, I upgraded
to the Indigo theme. I think I understood more of how Jekyll worked this time around. I think this is 
still my favorite out-of-the-box Jekyll template I've seen. It had these neat animations when you hovered
over my face, still haven't figured out how that works. This was around the time when I was taking the Preparing
for the Future Professoriate class with Dean DePauw, and we were required to setup RSS feeds  for our
weekly blogs.

# 2019 October - November

I finally outgrew Indigo in the middle of 2019. I had been increasingly seeing blogs setup to loosely template-wrap
org-mode markdown content. I liked the idea a lot, but having to migrate all my content out of Jekyll markdown
to org-mode markdown was not worth my time just yet when I didn't have a templating system that I felt
comfortable with. I decided to build a template from scratch, so I started with the [tutorial on the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
and modified things along the way. I don't think it took me more than an afternoon to become familiar with 
the CSS/HTML interactions with the Jekyll template specifications.

# 2019 November - December

I have been steadily learning more about CSS and fine tuning my setup since the major change.
For a while it was merely cosmetic.

## 2019 - 2020 (June)

Another major color theme change.

# 2020 June

In the middle of the quarantine and having defended my PhD, I 
am back to twiddling with the appearance of this site. With the help
of @reckoner165, I've learned to use the browser to figure out how to
rapidly prototype webpages and slowly overcome my <del>disdain</del> fear of javascript.
The latest version has a collapsible  sidebars, presenting navigation 
 on the left and a search bar on the right. Another major shift is that
I have now disabled Disqus on my website for a couple of reasons: 

1.  Disqus seems to be extremely buggy. The comment box fails to load 
    on half the pages, which makes it useless.
2.  For its buggy functionality, I learned that the disqus js code also seems
    quite bloated, loading on the order of 1 MB of data onto the page.

This seemed antithetical to my idea of a plain-HTML website, and I've removed the 
disqus js footer for now. I don't have a replacement system for comments,
but I might try using twitter as my interface to chat about my posts if anyone 
is interested.
