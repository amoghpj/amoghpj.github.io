As a requirement for Computing the Brain, a course I took in Fall
2016, I presented the Lu et al, 2016 paper on resynchronization in the
context of jetlag. To try and understand the basis for their model of
jetlag, I tried simulating the Kuramoto model myself. [Here](/assets/files/KuramotoSimulation_PyDSTool.py) is a
code to generate a simulation of the Kuramoto model, which outputs
something like this:
