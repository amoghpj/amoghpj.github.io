The `turtle` package in python makes generating procedural art trivial.
I really want to explore L-systems and fractals. I was thinking of space
filing patterns and I came across a link to kolams or rangolis on wikipedia.

Question: Can I make the (loop-line-)x3(curve-line)x2 pattern?

Surprisingly, this took less than 45 minutes from inspiration to execution.

    from turtle import *
    import numpy as np

Define the loop, and then the rule

    granularity = 10
    diameter = float(100)
    straight = diameter/np.sqrt(2.0)
    dela = 10
    def loop():
        delay(dela)
        forward(straight)
        left(45)
        circle(diameter/2,180)
        left(45)
        delay(dela)
        forward(straight)
    def rule():
        for _ in range(3):
            loop()
            forward(straight)
        for _ in range(2):
            #right(45)
            circle(diameter/2,90)
            forward(straight)
    setworldcoordinates(-400,-500,500,200)
    pensize(3)
    bgcolor("#302c2b")
    pencolor("#c98d82")
    #pencolor("#e8dcda")
    setheading(135)    
    hideturtle()
    
    for _ in range(4):
        rule()
    
    #exitonclick()
    ts = getscreen()
    ts.getcanvas().postscript(file='kolam_1.eps')
