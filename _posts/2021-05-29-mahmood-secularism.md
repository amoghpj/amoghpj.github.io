I've organized my notes from the book heirarchically. There are five chapters, indicated here by grey boxes. My notes are organized by chapter.
1. Black boxes are my notes/summaries of arguments from the book
2. Blue boxes are direct quotations
3. Green boxes are important legal cases mentioned in the book
4. Red boxes are concepts that were new to me.
