While the guiding mission statements of an institution might be broad and noble in their intentions, the actual mechanism of academia is almost formulaic: get published, get promoted. Thus, despite the good intentions of any acadmic institution, there exist loopholes that can be exploited by researchers to maximize personal gains while minimizing actual effort.

The reasons for committing scientific fraud are many, and depending on the background of the researcher and the adminnistrators of a research division the motivation and means might be varied. Departments might passively encourage low-quality-high yielding research in order to look better in terms of publications. Scientists might be motivated to utilize research grants for non-research purposes. Labs might even inadvertantly misuse grants for applications not covered  under the terms of the grant. Whatever the reason, fraud in research is definitely not as rare as scientists would have the public believe.

In this blog post, I examine one case study from the Office Of Reseach Integrity, involving one Mona Thiruchelvam of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
