A major challenge I faced during my rotation with the Hauf Lab was maintaining an electronic lab notebook. 

<p>The advantages of maintaining a paper Lab Notebook are many, including the fact that you can scribble notes and observations at will, it is easy to carry around, and remains a physical record of the mistakes and corrections that you make. On the other hand, the advantages of an electronic labnotebook seem, now, to outweigh those of a traditional paper record. It took me a while to get used to typing out observations and comments during the experiment instead of writing them down, but the fact is that it isn't hard at all. I have experimented with OO and have created a lab notebook template including features for making ToDo lists and comments/observations sections not directly pertinent to the experiment. You can find it <a href="AJ_NB_Template.ott">here</a>. However, I have also come across the amazing power and magnificent beauty of LaTex (again!), and will now use <a href="http://www.latextemplates.com/template/daily-laboratory-book">this</a> package, which seems perfect for my needs.</p>

<p>Update: Ever since I joined Dr. Murali's lab in spring 2016, my entire outlook towards documentation and file organization has changed. Enter <code>emacs24</code> and its amazing, all-powerful <code>org-mode</code>!!!!</p>
