title: Weekly journal article roundup
---
*What this is* This is a personal roundup of articles that have come out in past week that I found interesting. This page is more of a set of public bookmarks of things that I glanced through and found interesting, and where I can easily add public notes.  This is meant to hold me accountable for my weekly reading goals, but also curate a list of interesting papers that others might find useful.

*What this isn't* This page is NOT a catalog of papers that I have read carefully.  I construct this list automatically from an RSS feed, so more often that not, all I've read is the abstract.  I can't guarantee that links aren't repeated! If you find anything here interesting I'd be more than happy to chat about it!
