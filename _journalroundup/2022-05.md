- [(PLOS CB) Elementary vectors and autocatalytic sets for resource allocation in next-generation models of cellular growth](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009843)
- [(PLOS CB) Analytical kinetic model of native tandem promoters in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009824)
- [(PLOS CB) RNA length has a non-trivial effect in the stability of biomolecular condensates formed by RNA-binding proteins](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009810)
- [(PLOS CB) Identification of dynamic mass-action biochemical reaction networks using sparse Bayesian methods](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009830)
  - Work on inferring mass-action systems from data. The authors note that combinatorial explosion limits the utility of this apporach to about 20 species, which I also observed in BoolODE.
- [(PNAS - Comp Bio, Biophy) Structural and mechanistic basis of reiterative transcription initiation (Biophysics and Computational Biology)](http://www.pnas.org/content/119/5/e2115746119.short?rss=1)
  - Hadn't heard of reiterative transcription before.
