- [(PNAS - Comp Bio, Biophy) Volumetric compression develops noise-driven single-cell heterogeneity (Biophysics and Computational Biology)](http://www.pnas.org/content/118/51/e2110550118.short?rss=1)
- [(PNAS - Comp Bio, Biophy) On the sparsity of fitness functions and implications for learning (Biophysics and Computational Biology)](http://www.pnas.org/content/119/1/e2109649118.short?rss=1)
- [(eLife - Upcoming) A theory of synaptic transmission](https://elifesciences.org/articles/73585)
  - Propose a model of synaptic function at the level of vesicle release.  The model deals with the synaptic physiology integrating nerutransmitter release unlike the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron which only deals with action potentials fron within a neuron.
- [(Cell) Fundamental behaviors emerge from simulations of a living minimal cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01488-4?rss=yes)
- [(eLife - Upcoming) An empirical energy landscape reveals mechanism of proteasome in polypeptide translocation](https://elifesciences.org/articles/71911)
- [(eLife - Upcoming) Disruption of the TCA cycle reveals an ATF4-dependent integration of redox and amino acid metabolism](https://elifesciences.org/articles/72593)
  - "TCA cycle inhibition mimics an amino acid deprivation-like response and promotes compensatory reprogramming" in kidney cells.
- [(PLOS CB) Identification of periodic attractors in Boolean networks using <i>a priori</i> information](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009702)
